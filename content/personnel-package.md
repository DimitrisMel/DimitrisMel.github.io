## 2. Teaching Effectiveness

### 2.1 Teaching Statement (T1)

> *"Teaching should be such that what is offered is perceived as a valuable gift and not as a hard duty."*
> — Albert Einstein

#### Teaching Philosophy and Objectives

My teaching philosophy centers on the belief that students learn best through hands-on, practical experiences that connect theoretical concepts to real-world applications. Having transitioned from a Teaching Assistant role during my Ph.D. to managing my own courses at GVSU, I have developed a teaching approach grounded in three core principles: accessibility, engagement, and continuous improvement.

**Accessibility:** I strive to make complex technical material understandable to students with diverse backgrounds and at different stages in their academic journeys. In courses like CIS 337 and CIS 258, I teach students ranging from sophomores to seniors, with majors spanning cybersecurity, IT, IS, and even fields outside computing. This diversity presents a challenge: ensuring content is neither too difficult for beginners nor too mundane for advanced students. I address this by carefully calibrating my explanations, providing multiple perspectives on concepts, and offering additional support during office hours for those who need it.

**Engagement:** I believe that genuine engagement with material leads to deeper learning. Rather than simply lecturing, I incorporate interactive discussions, group activities, real-world case studies, projects, and extensive laboratory work into my courses. As one student noted: *"The professor was very active and engaged me in a lot of discussions."* I also genuinely care about my students' success, and they seem to recognize this.

**Continuous Improvement:** I view teaching as an evolving practice. Each semester, I reflect on what worked and what could be improved, incorporating student feedback and my own observations to refine my approach. This commitment to improvement is reflected in my evaluation trajectory.

My primary objectives as an instructor are to:
1. Prepare students for successful careers by teaching practical, industry-relevant skills
2. Develop students' critical thinking and problem-solving abilities
3. Foster intellectual curiosity and a deeper understanding of computing concepts
4. Create an inclusive learning environment where all students can succeed

#### Methodologies and Pedagogy

My pedagogical approach combines multiple instructional strategies to address different learning styles and maximize student engagement.

**Material Development from Multiple Sources:**
For each course I teach, I collect and synthesize material from multiple sources to create clear, concise, and engaging content:
- **Previous instructors:** I consult with colleagues who have taught the courses before, learning from their experience and building on their materials.
- **My graduate coursework:** I draw upon material from courses I took at the University of Florida during my Ph.D.
- **Textbooks and supplementary materials:** I incorporate content from adopted textbooks while supplementing with material from additional sources.
- **Real-world examples and case studies:** I integrate current events, security incidents, and industry practices to make material relevant and engaging.

Rather than simply adopting the original publisher slide decks, I modify them or create my own presentation materials for most courses and students have noticed this effort.

**Laboratory-Based Learning:**
Laboratory instruction is central to my teaching, particularly in CIS 337, CIS 418, and CIS 518. I invest significant time ensuring that lab material directly correlates with lecture content while being interesting and challenging. For CIS 337, I have created several labs from scratch. For CIS 418 and CIS 518, I utilize the SEED Labs framework while adding supplementary explanations, detailed rubrics, and video walkthroughs.

**Assessment Strategies:**
I use frequent, low-stakes assessments to help students stay current with material. Weekly quizzes in CIS 337 encourage consistent engagement with course content without creating excessive pressure. I have refined these assessments based on feedback, increasing the number of questions to provide more accurate reflections of student understanding. For capstone courses like CIS 468, I use peer reviews, time tracking (Clockify), and project management tools (Jira) to assess both individual contributions and team collaboration.

**Industry Integration:**
In CIS 468 (Cybersecurity Project), I have adopted the industry partnership model that provides students with real-world project experience. This requires extensive outreach to identify companies willing to sponsor projects, dedicate senior engineers to mentor student teams, and contribute financially to the program. Despite arriving at GVSU with no existing Michigan industry connections, I have successfully secured sponsors for all student teams in every semester, bringing in $10,000 in industry sponsorships.

#### Self-Evaluation of Teaching Effectiveness

I am proud of my teaching effectiveness during my first two and a half years at GVSU. My student evaluations demonstrate consistent quality with a positive trajectory:

- **Average Overall Summative Rating:** 4.18/5.0 across 14 evaluated sections
- **Average Instructor Effectiveness:** 4.28/5.0
- **Average Challenge and Engagement Index:** 5.12/7.0

Student comments consistently highlight my expertise, enthusiasm, and ability to explain complex concepts clearly:
- *"The enthusiasm and knowledge of the professor was top tier. He was extremely good at teaching the content and was able to answer every single student-asked question with very detailed answers. [...] If I could have this professor teach my other classes, assuming he had the same level of knowledge in those materials, I would more than gladly take that."*
- *"I often found him explaining things in different ways until I understood, which in my opinion is a sign that he truly understands what he's teaching."*
- *"The professor gave the perfect amount of homework, as well as quizzes. It wasn't too overwhelming, but it did keep the class on the forefront of my mind."*
- *"This was by far my favorite class all semester."*

I recognize areas where I continue to develop. Early in my tenure, students noted that lectures could be dense and that they wanted more interactive activities. I have systematically addressed these concerns, and later evaluations show marked improvement.

#### Response to Evaluations and Feedback

I systematically review evaluations each semester and implement concrete changes in response. Key examples include:

**Quiz Structure Improvements (CIS 337):**
Students indicated that quizzes with only 2-3 questions did not adequately reflect their understanding. In response, I increased the number of questions and extended quiz time to approximately 10 minutes, providing more accurate assessment of student learning.

**Increased Interactive Activities:**
In response to requests for more engagement, I incorporated additional group activities, real-life case studies, network design exercises, and interactive discussions during lectures.

**CIS 468 Course Structure Overhaul:**
After receiving feedback about lack of structure in Winter 2024, I consulted with Jonathan Engelsma, who runs the equivalent CS capstone course, and adopted his more refined model. Changes included anonymous peer reviews every two weeks, more frequent grade updates, structured weekly progress reports, and use of Clockify and Jira for tracking. The result: no similar complaints in subsequent semesters, and ratings improved from 4.5/5.0 to 4.8/5.0.

**Exam Weighting Adjustments (CIS 337):**
Students expressed concern that exams were weighted too heavily. Starting Winter 2025, I reduced the percentage of each midterm by 5%, providing more buffer through other assignments while maintaining academic rigor.

**Lab Enhancement:**
I made labs more challenging, requiring more critical thinking and problem-solving rather than simply following instructions. I also created new labs from scratch to better align with lecture content and industry needs.

**Supplementary Learning Materials (CIS 418):**
At student request, I recorded video walkthroughs of all lab activities, essentially creating a multi-delivery experience. This required substantial additional effort but was well-received: *"Even though the professor explains everything in class, the videos on Blackboard helped a lot."*

#### Teaching Development

**Collegial Collaboration:**

My collaboration with colleagues who have generously shared their expertise has been extremely valuable:
- **Kim Hawkins and Samah Mansour** provided guidance and materials for CIS 337
- **Jagadeesh Nandigam** shared his extensive experience with CIS 418 and CIS 518
- **Andrew Kalafut** provided advice on CIS 258 and CIS 468
- **Jonathan Engelsma** helped me restructure CIS 468 based on his successful CS capstone model
- **Hans Dulimarta and Christian Trefftz** provided material and advise on CIS 457 and CIS 654

These collaborations have accelerated my development as an instructor and helped me avoid common pitfalls while adopting proven practices. In turn, I have done my best to provide guidance and teaching materials to colleagues who subsequently teach courses I have previously taught.

**Course Assessment and Reflection:**
I have completed three Faculty Course Assessment Reports (FCARs) for my courses, engaging in structured reflection on course outcomes and areas for improvement. This formal assessment process complements my ongoing informal reflection and helps ensure I am meeting course learning objectives.

- *"He definitely went above and beyond in teaching certain concepts that I don't think I would've gotten in other networking courses like designing your own network based on tables or a budget."* — CIS 337, Winter 2025

**Constructive Feedback Received:**

Students have provided constructive suggestions in several areas:

- **Pacing and content density:** Some students noted that lectures could be dense, particularly in CIS 337. *"The lectures were early and dense in content. This made it difficult to get a good grasp of concepts without revisiting them myself at a later date."* — CIS 337, Fall 2023
- **Interactive activities:** Students requested more in-class activities. *"I would do more interactive activities in class, kind of like those exercises you did."* — CIS 337, Fall 2023
- **Quiz structure:** Early feedback indicated quizzes were too short. *"I think that giving students quizzes with more questions would be very helpful. There were multiple instances where I studied for a quiz, and found myself getting far below a 50% because there were only 2-3 questions."* — CIS 337, Fall 2023

#### Response to Feedback

I take student feedback seriously, as it is the only way for me to improve. I have systematically addressed concerns raised in evaluations, and the improvement in my ratings and student comments over time demonstrates the effectiveness of these changes.

**1. Quiz Structure Improvements (CIS 337):**
Students indicated that quizzes with only 2-3 questions did not adequately reflect their understanding. In response, I increased the number of questions and made quizzes at least 10 minutes long, providing a more accurate assessment of student learning. This change was implemented starting Winter 2024.

**2. Increased Interactive Activities:**
In response to requests for more engagement, I incorporated additional group activities, real-life case studies, and interactive discussions during lectures. Students in later semesters noted improvement: *"Yes it stretched my thinking and it was intellectually stimulating because we collaborated on topics in and out of class."* — CIS 337, Fall 2024

**3. CIS 468 Course Structure Overhaul:**
After receiving feedback about lack of structure in Winter 2024, I consulted with Jonathan Engelsma, who runs the equivalent CS capstone course, and adopted his more refined model. Some of the changes that were implemented are the following:
- Anonymous peer reviews every 2 weeks to address team collaboration issues
- More frequent grade updates so students know where they stand
- Structured weekly progress reports
- Use Clockify to log students' time spent on the project
- Use Jira to track progress and encourage collaboration between students

The result: no similar complaints in Fall 2024, and ratings improved from 4.5/5.0 to 4.8/5.0.

**4. Exam Weighting Adjustments (CIS 337):**
Students expressed concern that exams were weighted too heavily. Starting Winter 2025, I reduced the percentage of each midterm by 5%, providing more buffer through other assignments while maintaining academic rigor.

**5. Lab Enhancement:**
I made labs more challenging and designed them to require more critical thinking and problem-solving, rather than simply following instructions. Students responded positively: *"The labs helped the best, it was nice to do actual work with what we had been learning."* — CIS 337, Fall 2024

**6. Supplementary Learning Materials (CIS 418):**
At student request, I recorded video walkthroughs of all lab activities, effectively creating a multi-delivery experience. Students found this extremely helpful: *"Even though the professor explains everything in class, the videos on Blackboard helped a lot. If you ever forget anything or get stuck in any matter they help."* — CIS 418, Fall 2025

The trajectory of my evaluations, from initial ratings around 3.8-4.1 in my first semester to consistent ratings of 4.1-4.8 in recent semesters, demonstrates my commitment to continuous improvement and responsiveness to student needs. Below are some visualizations of the student ratings.

### 2.4 Curriculum and Laboratory Development (T5)

#### Approach to Course Material Development

Since joining GVSU, I have invested significant effort in developing high-quality instructional materials. For each course I teach, I collect and synthesize material from multiple sources to create clear, concise, and engaging content tailored to our students' needs:

- **Previous instructors:** I consulted with colleagues who had taught these courses before, including Kim Hawkins and Samah Mansour (CIS 337), Jagadeesh Nandigam (CIS 418, CIS 518), Andrew Kalafut (CIS 258, CIS 468), Jonathan Englesma (CIS 468), and Mostafa El-Said.
- **Textbooks and book-related resources:** I incorporated content from adopted textbooks while supplementing with additional explanations and examples.
- **My graduate coursework:** I drew upon material from similar courses I took at the University of Florida during my Ph.D. studies.
- **Scientific papers and industry standards:** I integrated current research and real-world practices to ensure relevance.
- **Internet resources and case studies:** I curated real-world examples, security incidents, and case studies to illustrate concepts.

Rather than simply adopting existing slide decks, I created my own presentation materials for most courses. As one student noted: *"The professor did not use the standard slide deck from the book often, he created his own. His lectures were very structured and included many examples, leaving out irrelevant material."* — CIS 258, Winter 2024

#### Laboratory Development

Laboratory instruction is central to my teaching philosophy, and I have developed extensive hands-on lab materials for my courses.

**CIS 337: Network Systems Management**

CIS 337 requires 2 hours of lab work every week, and I have created numerous labs from scratch to ensure they directly correlate with lecture content while being interesting and challenging. My lab development for CIS 337 includes:

- **Wireshark packet analysis labs:** Students capture and analyze network traffic to understand protocols in action
- **Network design exercises:** Students design networks based on requirements, constraints, and budgets, skills directly applicable to industry positions
- **Socket programming project:** A hands-on programming assignment that reinforces understanding of network communication
- **Protocol-specific labs:** Labs covering DNS, DHCP, routing, VLANs, and other networking concepts

These labs were well-received by students:
- *"I really enjoyed the Labs. I loved working with Wireshark and figuring out how the network and some of its protocols worked."* — CIS 337, Winter 2025
- *"The labs were really helpful giving me hands-on experience with what we were doing but the lectures were honestly just as important."* — CIS 337, Winter 2025
- *"He definitely went above and beyond in teaching certain concepts that I don't think I would've gotten in other networking courses like designing your own network based on tables or a budget. Also including a socket programming project."* — CIS 337, Winter 2025

**CIS 418 and CIS 518: Secure Software Engineering**

For Secure Software Engineering, I adopted the SEED Labs framework developed by Professor Wenliang Du, which provides well-structured hands-on security labs. My contributions include:

- Adapting lab instructions and adding supplementary explanations for our student population
- Creating detailed rubrics requiring students to explain not just what they did, but why each step works
- Recording video walkthroughs of all lab activities (Fall 2025), essentially creating multi-delivery content
- Developing take-home tasks that extend the in-class labs

Students valued this hands-on approach: *"The 5 labs + extra seed lab project helped me get a better understanding of not only a few different types of exploits in software but actually doing them and seeing how they alter a system was even better."* — CIS 418, Fall 2025

**CIS 258: Introduction to Cybersecurity**

For the introductory cybersecurity course, I developed:

- Custom presentation slides with extensive real-world examples and case studies
- A semester-long research project where students investigate and present cybersecurity topics
- Homework assignments designed to test application of concepts to real scenarios

**CIS 468: Cybersecurity Project**

CIS 468 is fundamentally different from any other course in our curriculum, and its preparation requires a unique and substantial time investment. Unlike traditional courses where an instructor can prepare materials once and make incremental improvements each semester, CIS 468 requires extensive outreach and relationship-building every single semester.

The course is comprised of semester-long capstone projects provided by industry sponsors. My responsibilities include:

- **Industry outreach and networking:** I actively seek out companies willing to sponsor student projects, which requires building relationships with industry professionals across Michigan; a significant undertaking given that I arrived in the state with no existing industry connections.
- **Pitching and convincing sponsors:** I present GVSU's mission and the value of our capstone program to potential sponsors, persuading them to collaborate with us, dedicate senior engineers to mentor student teams weekly, and contribute $2,500 per project per semester.
- **Ongoing sponsor management:** I coordinate between student teams and sponsors throughout the semester, ensuring productive collaboration and addressing any issues that arise.

This PR-intensive preparation cannot be reused. Every semester I must find new projects for new student teams. Despite these challenges, I have successfully secured sponsors and projects for all student teams in every semester I have taught CIS 468, bringing in **$10,000 in industry sponsorships** to the College (Winter 2024: $2,500; Fall 2024: $2,500; Winter 2025: $5,000).

In addition to sponsor acquisition, I developed course infrastructure including:

- Project management frameworks and weekly reporting templates
- Presentation rubrics and professional communication guidelines
- Sponsor relationship protocols and student-sponsor interaction guidelines
- Clockify time-tracking integration for accountability and contribution assessment
- Anonymous peer review system (every 2 weeks) to address team dynamics proactively
- Collaboration between sponsors and students through Jira

#### Continuous Improvement

I continuously refine my course materials based on student feedback and evolving industry needs. Each semester, I review what worked well and what could be improved, making enhancements to slides, labs, and assignments. This iterative approach has contributed to the improvement in my teaching evaluations over time.

### 2.7 Course Revisions (T8)

Of all the courses I have taught, CIS 337 (Network Systems Management) represents my most significant investment in course revision. Having taught 6 sections of this course across 3 semesters (Fall 2023, Fall 2024, and Winter 2025), I have had some opportunity to refine and substantially improve the course. The improvements I have made fall into three main categories: lecture slides, in-class exercises, and laboratory assignments.

#### Lecture Slide Revisions

When I first taught CIS 337 in Fall 2023, I inherited the publisher's slide deck that accompanies the textbook. Over the course of three semesters, I have revised the lecture slides in the following ways:

- **Revised publisher slides:** I rewrote/edited some slides for each chapter, creating my own presentations that emphasize clarity, visual learning, and practical examples.
- **Incorporated my own coursework materials:** I drew upon materials from CNT 5106C (Computer Networks), a graduate-level course I took at the University of Florida during my Ph.D. studies. This allowed me to bring a deeper, more rigorous perspective to topics such as routing protocols, network security, and performance analysis.
- **Added content from additional textbooks:** I supplemented the adopted textbook with material from other networking textbooks to provide alternative explanations and broader coverage of certain topics.
- **Integrated real-world case studies:** I incorporated current examples of network incidents, security breaches, and industry practices to make the material more relevant and engaging.

#### In-Class Exercises

In response to student feedback requesting more interactive activities, I developed a series of in-class exercises designed to reinforce lecture concepts and encourage active learning:

- **Network design exercises:** Students design networks based on given requirements, constraints, and budgets, a skill directly applicable to industry positions.
- **Protocol analysis activities:** Students analyze packet captures and protocol behavior to understand how theoretical concepts manifest in practice.
- **Troubleshooting scenarios:** Students diagnose network problems presented in case study format, developing critical thinking and problem-solving skills.
- **Calculation exercises:** Students practice subnet calculations, addressing schemes, and other quantitative aspects of networking.

These exercises were developed iteratively based on which topics students found most challenging. Below are sample in-class exercises I created for CIS 337:

| Topic | Exercise | Solution |
|-------|----------|----------|
| NAT | [Exercise 1](/docs/exercises/nat_exercise_1.pdf) | [Solution](/docs/exercises/nat_exercise_1_solutions.pdf) |
| NAT | [Exercise 2](/docs/exercises/nat_exercise_2.pdf) | [Solution](/docs/exercises/nat_exercise_2_solutions.pdf) |
| NAT | [Exercise 3](/docs/exercises/nat_exercise_3.pdf) | [Solution](/docs/exercises/nat_exercise_3_solutions.pdf) |
| NAT, ARP, DNS, and Routing | [Exercise 1](/docs/exercises/nat_arp_dns_routing_exercise_1.pdf) | [Solution](/docs/exercises/nat_arp_dns_routing_exercise_1_solutions.pdf) |
| Network Bandwidth | [Exercise 1](/docs/exercises/network_bandwidth_exercise_1.pdf) | [Solution](/docs/exercises/network_bandwidth_exercise_1_solutions.pdf) |
| Network Bandwidth | [Exercise 2](/docs/exercises/network_bandwidth_exercise_2.pdf) | [Solution](/docs/exercises/network_bandwidth_exercise_2_solutions.pdf) |
| Network Bandwidth | [Exercise 3](/docs/exercises/network_bandwidth_exercise_3.pdf) | [Solution](/docs/exercises/network_bandwidth_exercise_3_solutions.pdf) |
| Subnets | [Exercise 1](/docs/exercises/subnets_exercise_1.pdf) | [Solution](/docs/exercises/subnets_exercise_1_solutions.pdf) |
| Subnets | [Exercise 2](/docs/exercises/subnets_exercise_2.pdf) | [Solution](/docs/exercises/subnets_exercise_2_solutions.pdf) |

#### Laboratory Assignment Revisions

The most significant revision effort went into the laboratory component of CIS 337. The course requires 2 hours of lab work every week, and I recognized early on that the existing labs needed substantial improvement. My lab revisions included:

**Revising Existing Labs:**
- Updated outdated instructions and screenshots to reflect current software versions
- Added more detailed explanations of the underlying concepts being demonstrated
- Created clearer rubrics that require students to explain not just what they did, but why each step works
- Increased the challenge level to require more critical thinking rather than simply following instructions

**Creating New Labs from Scratch:**
- **Network design lab:** A lab where students design a complete network for a fictional organization, including IP addressing, routing, VLANs, and budget considerations.
- **Socket programming assignment:** A hands-on programming project that reinforces understanding of network communication at the application layer.
- **Advanced routing labs:** Labs covering NAT, ARP, DNS, and routing with configuration exercises and analysis.

The impact of these lab revisions is evident in student feedback:
- *"I really enjoyed the Labs. I loved working with Wireshark and figuring out how the network and some of its protocols worked."* — CIS 337, Winter 2025
- *"The labs were really helpful giving me hands-on experience with what we were doing but the lectures were honestly just as important."* — CIS 337, Winter 2025
- *"He definitely went above and beyond in teaching certain concepts that I don't think I would've gotten in other networking courses like designing your own network based on tables or a budget. Also including a socket programming project."* — CIS 337, Winter 2025

Below are sample laboratory assignments I created for CIS 337:

| Lab | Assignment | Solution |
|-----|------------|----------|
| Lab 7: NAT, ARP, DNS, and Routing | [Assignment](/docs/labs/lab7_nat_arp_dns_routing.docx) | [Solution](/docs/labs/lab7_nat_arp_dns_routing_answers.docx) |
| Lab 8: Subnets | [Assignment](/docs/labs/lab8_subnets.doc) | [Solution](/docs/labs/lab8_subnets_answers.doc) |
| Lab 9: Network Design | [Assignment](/docs/labs/lab9_network_design.docx) | [Solution](/docs/labs/lab9_network_design_answers.docx) |

#### Impact of Revisions

The cumulative effect of these revisions is reflected in my improving evaluation scores for CIS 337. My Instructor Effectiveness ratings increased from an average of 4.0/5.0 in Fall 2023 to 4.4/5.0 in Winter 2025. This trajectory demonstrates that the time invested in course revision directly translates to improved student learning experiences.

## 3. Scholarly and Creative Activity

### 3.1 Research Statement (R1)

#### Research Agenda

My research focuses on computer networking and privacy-preserving machine learning. My work addresses fundamental challenges in how we measure, monitor, and secure network traffic at scale, as well as how we can perform machine learning training while protecting sensitive data. My research agenda is organized around the following two themes:

**1. Network Traffic Measurement and Data Streaming Algorithms:**
My primary research area involves developing efficient algorithms and data structures (known as "sketches") for measuring network traffic in real time. Networks generate massive volumes of data that cannot be stored or processed using traditional methods. My work develops compact, probabilistic data structures that can answer important queries (such as detecting anomalies, measuring flow spreads, and identifying security threats) using minimal memory and processing time. This research has resulted in publications at top venues including VLDB, SIGMETRICS (POMACS), IEEE INFOCOM, and Transactions on Networking.

**2. Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning:**
My second research thrust addresses the challenge of training machine learning models on sensitive data. In healthcare and other domains, data owners cannot share raw data due to privacy regulations. My work develops techniques that allow neural networks to be trained on obfuscated data, enabling cloud-based machine learning while preserving data confidentiality. This research began during my Ph.D. with publications at ICTAI and IC3, and has expanded at GVSU to include new work on matrix masking techniques for images, targeting venues such as NeurIPS and AAAI.

#### Chronicle of Scholarly Activities

My scholarly journey at GVSU builds upon the research foundation I established during my Ph.D. at the University of Florida under the supervision of Dr. Shigang Chen.

**Continuing Ph.D. Research (2023-2024):**
Upon joining GVSU, I continued collaborating with my Ph.D. colleagues on several ongoing projects. This resulted in a publication at IEEE INFOCOM 2025 on flow spread measurement, and two papers currently under review at IEEE Transactions on Networking. I also supervised a graduate research assistant working on a journal extension of our SIGMETRICS 2023 paper on real-time spread burst detection.

**Establishing Independent Research at GVSU (2024-2025):**
In my second year, I began developing my independent research program at GVSU. I secured $15,000 in Seed Fund support (with Co-PI Sara Sutton) for a project on "Real-Time Network Packet Detection for Enhanced Security in Fog Computing." This project has engaged three research assistants and has resulted in a paper currently under review at ACM CoNEXT.

**Expanding Research Directions (2025-2026):**
I have expanded my research to include privacy-preserving machine learning for images, building on my earlier work on medical data privacy. Working with undergraduate student Taher Turki and graduate student Morgan Vanderleest, we are developing two papers targeting NeurIPS and AAAI on matrix masking techniques for neural network training.

**Grant Activity:**
I have actively pursued external funding. I submitted a proposal to the NSF CRII program ($175,000) and I collaborated on a $1,000,000 proposal to Google's Cybersecurity Clinics Fund. I am currently developing a proposal for the NSF CICI program, building directly on my Seed Fund research.

#### Publication Venues

I have consistently targeted the most prestigious venues in my research areas:

**Top-Tier Journals:**
- **IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking:** The premier journal in computer networking, with an impact factor of 3.7. I have one published paper and two under review.
- **IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering:** A respected IEEE journal covering network science.

**Top-Tier Conferences:**
- **VLDB (Very Large Data Bases):** One of the top database conferences. I published a first-author paper in 2023.
- **SIGMETRICS/POMACS:** The top venue for performance evaluation and measurement. I have one publication from 2023.
- **IEEE INFOCOM:** The premier conference in computer networking. I have one publication from 2025.
- **ACM CoNEXT:** A prestigious networking conference. I have one paper under review.

**Other Venues:**
My earlier work appeared at IEEE ICTAI, IEEE CLOUD, and various other IEEE and ACM conferences, establishing my publication record during my Ph.D.

#### Reflections on Development as Teacher-Scholar

My research and teaching are deeply interconnected. The courses I teach, CIS 337 (Network Systems Management), CIS 418 and CIS 518 (Secure Software Engineering), and CIS 457 and CIS 654 (Data Communications/Computer Networking), directly relate to my research in network measurement and security.

This connection manifests in several ways:

**Research-Informed Teaching:**
My research on network traffic measurement informs how I teach network protocols and analysis in CIS 337. When students learn about packet capture and protocol analysis using Wireshark, I can provide context from my research on how these techniques scale to high-speed networks.

**Teaching-Informed Research:**
My teaching of CIS 468 (Cybersecurity Project) has connected me with industry partners whose real-world challenges inform my research directions. The IoT security focus of my Seed Fund project emerged partly from interactions with industry sponsors.

**Student Involvement in Research:**
I have actively involved GVSU students in my research program. Seven students have contributed to research projects, with five already co-authoring papers under development or review. This mentorship extends my impact beyond the classroom while providing students with valuable research experience.

#### Future Research Plans

My research agenda for the coming years focuses on three priorities:

**1. Securing External Funding:**
I am developing a proposal for the NSF CICI program based on my Seed Fund research. I will continue pursuing NSF and other external funding opportunities to support graduate students and expand my research program.

**2. Expanding IoT Security Research:**
I plan to extend my sketch-based threat detection work to additional IoT contexts, including smart infrastructure and industrial control systems. This research has strong potential for industry collaboration and practical impact.

**3. Advancing Privacy-Preserving ML:**
I will continue developing matrix masking techniques for privacy-preserving machine learning, targeting applications in healthcare, finance, and other privacy-sensitive domains.

**4. Involving More Students:**
I aim to grow my research group, involving more GVSU students in publishable research and providing them with mentorship that prepares them for graduate school or research-oriented careers.

I serve on the advisory board of the Careerline Tech Center, providing guidance on program improvement and strategic planning. I have represented GVSU at the Careerline Tech Center twice (2024 and 2025), presenting to high school students about opportunities in computing at GVSU.

I have participated in the GrrCon cybersecurity conference, representing the College of Computing alongside colleagues. Through the Future PREP'd program, I mentored three high school students on professional development and college preparation. I have also presented my research at Innovation Day and the Graduate Student Engagement event, and served as a moderator for the "Current State and Future of Cybersecurity" panel at Innovation Day in April 2025.

#### Industry Connections

Through my role as CIS 468 instructor, I have built relationships with numerous industry partners who sponsor capstone projects. These connections benefit not only my students but also the broader College of Computing by strengthening ties with companies such as Gordon Food Service, Wolverine Worldwide, Rapid7, Dematic, and others. I have also initiated conversations with organizations like Arista Networks about potential sponsorships for infrastructure and student scholarships.

In summary, my service contributions reflect my commitment to being a collegial and engaged member of the GVSU community while building connections that benefit our students and programs.

## 5. Conclusion

This document presents evidence that I am on a strong trajectory toward tenure at Grand Valley State University. According to the new College of Computing Standards and Criteria for Tenure-line Faculty Personnel Evaluation, contract renewal requires demonstrating progress toward being excellent in at least one of teaching or scholarly activity, at least accomplished in the other, and at least competent in service. My record demonstrates that I exceed these expectations, with evidence supporting excellence in both teaching and scholarly activity, along with accomplished service.

**Excellence in Teaching:**
In my first two and a half years at GVSU, I have taught 21 course sections across 9 distinct courses, achieving an average Overall Summative Rating of 4.18/5.0 and Instructor Effectiveness of 4.28/5.0. My trajectory shows measurable improvement: my CIS 337 Instructor Effectiveness ratings have increased from 4.0/5.0 in Fall 2023 to 4.4/5.0 in Winter 2025. I have developed extensive course materials and laboratory exercises, supervised 6 Master's Project students and 37 undergraduate capstone students, and secured $10,000 in industry sponsorships for CIS 468. Student feedback consistently highlights my expertise, enthusiasm, and ability to explain complex concepts in multiple ways.

**Excellence in Scholarly and Creative Activity:**
My publication record demonstrates sustained productivity in top-tier venues. I have published at VLDB, SIGMETRICS (POMACS), IEEE INFOCOM, and IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking, the most prestigious venues in computer networking and data management. I currently have three papers under review at Transactions on Networking and ACM CoNEXT, with two additional papers under development targeting NeurIPS and AAAI. I have secured $16,930 in internal funding and submitted proposals to NSF and Google, with an NSF CICI proposal currently in development. Importantly, I have actively involved 7 GVSU students in my research, with 5 already co-authoring papers under development or review.

**Accomplished Service:**
I have contributed to the university at the department, college, and university levels through committee work including the Faculty Search Committee, Research Committee, Ph.D. Proposal Committee, Faculty Grievance Committee, Commencement Speaker Selection Committee, and others. I contribute to the profession through peer review for top venues and served as a VLDB Area Chair. My community engagement includes K-12 outreach at the Careerline Tech Center, advisory board membership, participation in GrrCon, and mentorship through Future PREP'd.

**Looking Forward:**
I am committed to continued growth as a teacher-scholar at GVSU. In teaching, I will continue refining my courses based on student feedback and expanding my laboratory materials. In research, I will pursue external funding through NSF CICI and other programs, expand my work on IoT security and privacy-preserving machine learning, and involve more students in publishable research. In service, I will continue contributing to governance, strengthening industry partnerships, and engaging in outreach activities.

I am grateful for the mentorship and support I have received from my colleagues in the College of Computing and look forward to continuing my contributions to GVSU's mission of educating students and advancing knowledge in computing.
