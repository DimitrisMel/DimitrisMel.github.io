# Case for Contract Renewal

**Dimitrios Melissourgos, Ph.D.**
Assistant Professor of Computer Science
Department of Computer Science, College of Computing
Grand Valley State University

---

## Summary

This document presents my case for contract renewal after three years of service at Grand Valley State University (Fall 2023 - Present). Following the College of Computing's Standards and Criteria for Tenure-line Faculty Personnel Evaluation (February 2025), I demonstrate that I meet the criteria for:

- **Teaching: Excellent**
- **Scholarly and Creative Activity: Excellent**
- **Service: Accomplished**

Per Section 1.A.i of the Personnel Evaluation document, contract renewal requires the faculty member to be "on the trajectory to (1) be judged excellent in at least one of the teaching or research categories, (2) be judged at least accomplished in the other category, and (3) be judged at least competent in service."

I exceed these requirements by demonstrating excellence in both teaching and research, with accomplished service contributions.

## Teaching (Excellent)

### Teaching Statement (T1)

My teaching philosophy centers on preparing students for real-world cybersecurity and networking challenges through hands-on, industry-relevant experiences. I believe effective computing education requires bridging the gap between theoretical concepts and practical application, which I achieve through project-based learning, industry partnerships, and continuous course improvement.

Since joining GVSU, I have taught a diverse range of courses spanning cybersecurity, network management, and computer science fundamentals. I consistently seek student feedback and peer evaluations to refine my teaching methods, and I actively revise course materials to reflect current industry practices and emerging technologies.

My commitment to high-quality instruction is evidenced by:
- Consistently positive student evaluations across all courses
- Significant curriculum development for multiple courses (CIS 258, 337, 468, 518)
- Successful industry partnerships that provide real-world capstone experiences
- Recognition from colleagues for teaching excellence

**CIS 468 Industry Sponsorships:**
- Fall 2024: $2,500 from Wolverine Worldwide
- Winter 2025: $5,000 from Dematic and Kismet

These partnerships provide students with real-world cybersecurity projects, professional mentorship, and industry exposure while bringing external funding to support course activities.
