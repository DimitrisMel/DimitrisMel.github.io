  # Short bio for homepage
  bio: |
    I specialize in two primary research domains: **network traffic measurement** and
    **privacy-preserving machine learning**. My work on network traffic measurement
    emphasizes accurate collection of network data using compact data structures called
    sketches for applications including load balancing and security monitoring. I also
    develop techniques to safeguard sensitive data during remote neural network training.

    I teach cybersecurity and network management courses at both graduate and undergraduate
    levels. Outside academia, I enjoy scuba diving, drone flying, travel, spearfishing,
    and home lab development.
