  # Short bio for homepage
  bio: |
    I am an Assistant Professor at the Department of Computer Science, College of Computing, Grand Valley State University.
    
    I conduct research in two primary areas: **network traffic measurement** and
    **privacy-preserving machine learning**.
    
    My work on network traffic measurement emphasizes accurate collection of network data using compact data structures called
    sketches for applications such as load balancing and security monitoring.
    
    My research on machine learning privacy revolves around training artificial neural networks without revealing the underlying data.
    The main technique used to achieve this is called matrix masking.

    I teach mainly cybersecurity and computer networking courses at both graduate and undergraduate
    levels.
    
    Outside academia, I enjoy scuba diving, building and flying drones, travelling, spearfishing, and developing my homelab.
